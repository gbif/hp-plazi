The [European Journal of Taxonomy](https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu) is a fully refereed, international, electronic open access journal in descriptive taxonomy, covering subjects in zoology (including entomology), botany (in its broadest sense), mycology, and palaeontology.

It provides immediate free open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports and encourages a greater global exchange of knowledge.

### Journal history

The European Journal of Taxonomy was initiated by a task force of six people from the [EDIT](http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/) (European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy) network who worked together from June 2009 to September 2011 to propose a joint journal that would solve some of the issues identified in shifting from paper to e-only publishing for institutional journals in taxonomy. The task force was given a mandate by the EDIT directors to investigate the need for and feasibility of launching such a joint e-journal. After their investigation, the task force presented a business model involving natural history institutions (NHIs). Five NHIs (National Museum of Natural History, Paris, France; Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium; Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium; Natural History Museum, London, United Kingdom; Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, Belgium) offered their financial support and/or their in-kind support (skilled publishing staff, IT staff), which provides autonomy for the journal. After a proofing period of the publishing model, workflow model and editorial team organisation, the first article was published on September 9<sup>th</sup> 2011.

### Journal data

From its launch, the European Journal of Taxonomy has committed to ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR principles) of its data.

In 2017, the consortium partnered with Swiss-based organization [Plazi](https://plazi.org/) to retroconvert the metadata of articles published in PDF format, along with the taxonomic treatments and material citations they contain, into XML Taxpub format. To ensure adequate granularity, the journal adopted a new standard for formatting the material ([Chester et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.5852/ejt.2019.586)). The articles, as well as the associated treatments, figures, and metadata, are deposited in the [Biodiversity Literature Repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/biosyslit) (Zenodo) to be disseminated across various relevant data infrastructures, such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and [Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/), and the shared [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/).

However, it should be noted that this workflow has certain limitations. The retroconversion of an unstructured article, despite the use of quality control tools, may lead to slight discrepancies. GBIF has introduced a feedback mechanism for each material citation, allowing users to alert Plazi about erroneous conversions, which will be corrected in due course. Catalogue of Life users and editors regularly check the data quality of the taxonomic data from digitized literature and report issues to the Plazi team as well.

To prevent discrepancies and enrich articles, EJT initiated the development of a new workflow based on the XML-first approach (MetoTaxa), in collaboration with Plazi and the University of Caen-Normandie. After several years of development, testing, and improvements, the tool will be released in 2025.
